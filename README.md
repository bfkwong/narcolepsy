#### Welcome to Nudge!

##### Nudge is a React Native application that decreases the effects of Narcolepsy for users.

###### Inspiration
People with Narcolepsy often can't stop themselves from falling asleep. 
During certain hours of the day, they get sleepy but sleeping will not help them most of the time.
We wanted to make an app that keeps them from feeling sleepy.

###### What it does
Has a User sourced/ crowdsourced To-do list page of tips and tricks from other narcolepsy.  
Provides a graph of “sleepiness” trends created from machine learning during the day/sleepiness predictiveness
Keeps track of daily activities to determine graph
###### How we built it
React Native and Machine Learning with a Firebase database
###### Challenges we ran into
Learning Javascript, implementing machine learning, syncing with the database
###### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working as a team, learning new frameworks
###### What we learned
React Native, GitHub, teamwork, Node.JS, Firebase
###### What's next for Nudge
Backend, supporter send a notification to a second user
