#### Welcome to Nudge!

##### Nudge is a React Native application that decreases the effects of Narcolepsy for users

###### Inspiration
-People with Narcolepsy often can't stop themselves from falling asleep
-During certain hours of the day, they get sleepy but sleeping will not help them most of the time
-We wanted to make an app that keeps them from feeling sleepy

###### What it does
-Has a User sourced/ crowdsourced To-do list page of tips and tricks from other people with narcolepsy
-Provides a graph of “sleepiness” trends created from machine learning during the day/sleepiness predictiveness and keeps track of daily activities to determine a graph of thier sleep patterns
###### How we built it
-React Native and Machine Learning with a Firebase database (Real-time Cloud Storage)
###### Challenges we ran into
-Learning Javascript, implementing machine learning, syncing with the database
###### Accomplishments that we're proud of
-Working as a team and learning the new frameworks
###### What we learned
-React Native, GitHub, teamwork, Node.JS, Firebase
###### What's next for Nudge
-Backend supporter to send a notification to a second user
-Security camera with video classification to see when they’re nodding off
